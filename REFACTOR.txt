== Potlatch 2 refactoring ==

Aims:
- to enable multiple Maps to be shown on-screen (e.g. for junction editor)
- to bring Connection and VectorLayer code together

Current status:
- it loads a map and lets you edit it!
- VectorLayers (of any shape) will not work - lots of them are commented out
- Save/OAuth not tested

== Changes overall ==

Map.as becomes a collection of MapPaint objects, all with the same lat/long/scale
(plus a backdrop sprite and a background imagery sprite)
Map.editableLayer returns a reference to the single MapPaint object where isBackground is false

MapPaint.as gains a reference to a Connection - i.e. the source data for this layer

== Stuff to look at ==

There are lots more of these throughout the code, marked with fixmes of the form '>>>> REFACTOR'

MapPaint.as
- wayuis, nodeuis etc. should ideally be private
- removeLayer should blank

Global changes:
- remove all back-references to Map except where necessary for lat/long/scale
- getParam is messy - stuff sent via flashvars needs somewhere to live: currently in Globals which is ugly
- AttentionEvents are derelict and commented out
- tileset/setbackground stuff is screwed up again and needs refactoring a little
